Soil Type Prediction & Crop Recommendation using LightGBM
---------------------------------------------------------
Soil Type Prediction & Crop Recommendation is a web-based machine learning tool built with Python (Flask) and LightGBM. It helps predict the soil type and suggests the most suitable crop based on key agricultural inputs like soil nutrients, moisture, temperature, and rainfall.

This project simplifies precision farming by offering farmers or agriculturalists a quick and intuitive way to optimize crop selection for their land conditions.

Features
--------
 Easy form to input soil and climate parameters (pH, N, P, K, moisture, temperature, rainfall)

 Predicts soil type using a trained LightGBM model

 Recommends the best crop for the predicted soil type

 Real-time results with clean web interface (HTML/CSS + Flask backend)

 Fast, lightweight, and efficient model performance
